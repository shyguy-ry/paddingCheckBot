# Under The Hood
This work uses the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), and the [python-telegram package](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot). The basic command is /check, which has they syntax:
  ```
  /check @username
  ```
The code works to generate a pseudo random number between 1 and 6 (basically rolling a die), and then assigning a status based on that number. Based on this status, it picks a response from a list of possible corresponding responses and reports it back to the user.

As of v0.2 there is a "Certified Big" mechanic which can acts as an opt-out for people who do not wish to be checked. In future versions this list will be able to be edited dynamically, but that is currently under development.
